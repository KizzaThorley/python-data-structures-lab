# print('hello world')

# Exercise 0: Example
#
# This is a practice exercise to familiarize you with basic Python data structures.
#
# Create a list called `example_list` and append three elements to it. Print each element using a loop.
#
# Requirements:
# - The list should contain any three elements of your choice.
# - Use a loop to print each element.

# def example_list_function():
#   example_list = ['element1', 'element2', 'element3']
#   for element in example_list:
#       print(element)

# # Call the function and print each element
# example_list_function()


# Exercise 1: List and Indexing
#
# Create a list named students containing at least three student names (strings).
# Assign the second student’s name to a variable named first_student.
# Assign the last student’s name to a variable named last_student.

# def manage_students():
#     # your code here
#     students = ["tom", 'sam', 'ben']
#     first_student = students[1]
#     last_student = students[-1]
#     return (f'the first is {first_student} and last is {last_student}')


# # Call the function and print the result
# print('Exercise 1:', manage_students())



# Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation
#
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Create a variable named meal and assign an empty string to it.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the strings in foods and append each string to meal.

# def combine_foods():
#     # your code here
#     foods = ('Orange', 'Pear', 'Apple')
#     meal = ''
#     for food in foods:
#         meal += food + ' '

    
#     return meal.strip()


# # Call the function and print the result
# print('Exercise 2:', combine_foods())


# Exercise 3: Slicing Tuples
#
# Using the slice operator, assign a new tuple containing only the last two food strings in the foods to a variable named last_two_foods.

# def slice_foods():
#     # your code here
#      foods = ('Orange', 'Pear', 'Apple')
#      last_two_foods = foods[-2:]
#      return last_two_foods

# # Call the function and print the result
# print('Exercise 3:', slice_foods())


# Exercise 4: Dictionaries and String Formatting
#
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state, and population.
# Using the home_town dictionary, assign to a variable named home_town_message a string with this format: “I was born in <city>, <state> - population of <population>”

# def hometown_info():
#     # your code here
#     home_town = {
#         'city': 'cheltenham',
#         'state': 'glos',
#         'population': 100000
#     }
#     home_town_message = f'I was born in {home_town["city"]}, {home_town["state"]} - population of {home_town["population"]}'
#     return home_town_message

# # Call the function and print the result
# print('Exercise 4:', hometown_info())


# Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items
#
# Define an empty list named home_town_items.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the key: value pairs in the home_town dictionary and append a string with the following format to home_town_items: "<key> = <value>"

# def list_home_town_items():
#     # your code here
#     home_town = {
#         'city': 'cheltenham',
#         'state': 'glos',
#         'population': 100000
#     }
#     home_town_items = []
    
#     for key, value in home_town.items():
#      home_town_items.append(f'{key} = {value}')
#     return home_town_items

# # Call the function and print the result
# print('Exercise 5:', list_home_town_items())
